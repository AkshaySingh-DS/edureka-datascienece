    "    LifeTel Telecom is the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market of Singapore. It issues SIM to the verified users. Till now verification was manual through the photocopy of the approved id card document. However, the government has recently introduced a Social ID called Reference ID which is mapped to the fingerprint of the user. LifeTel should now verify the user against the fingerprint and Reference ID\n",
